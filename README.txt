here I have made a couple of changes to my
launch.json and tasks.json files

in the tasks.json I just made it to always
compile to the same a.exe file

and in the launch.json I just clicked on the
add configuration button and chose the "(Windows) Launch"
and added a ' "preLaunchTask": "C/C++: g++.exe build active file" '
just so that it compiles before running the code

what the "(windows) Launch" does is it runs the program
in command prompt (cmd)

the classes files just speak for them selves
I don't need to explain how they wrok here
(I explained the important parts in the files)
